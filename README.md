# Project Euler Haskell

This contains the solutions to Project Euler problems 1-58 solved in Haskell

### About

From the Project Euler website:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than 
> just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, 
> the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
> 
> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind 
> to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

### Development

Delevolpment was started on July of 2015. This was right as I started learning haskell so I could put it to use.
I had previously solved these problems in both C++ and Java, however since haskell is a functional programming,
the way I went about solving the problems was very different than I did in the imperative languages.
